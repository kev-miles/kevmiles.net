						<p class="text-justify">I worked directly with the people that made the games I've enjoyed for decades, and even got to work exclusively with the Online Game Modes team from EA Vancouver for a while.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">Over the course of the project I estimated and took ownership of several features across the Online/Offline fronts, as well as some screens and front-end logic towards the end of the project. Some of them are: The offline rivalry system in the Arcade Modes, adapting the localization code from the NHL games into the UFC codebase, handling the data transfer for custom fighters in the Online Modes, handling fighter animations on the menus and presenting the EA Access offers in-game through a dedicated screen.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">Everything was done on EA's proprietary technology, which was hard to figure out at first, but became an incredible learning experience over the course of the development.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">It was also a deeply enjoyable time, given the incredible team that I found on this project.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">The game went on to top the sales charts and received good reviews from the press, so I'm very proud of the end result, and it was really hard for me to move on once my work was done.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">Shortly before release, I was moved to a different project within Globant, and eventually left the company altogether. Nonetheless, this experience remains one of the highlights of my career, and a source of many good memories.</p>
