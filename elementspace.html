						<p class="text-justify">I joined the team as Level Designer shortly before the project entered its production phase, where I helped deliver its final Vertical Slice and witnessed the prototype transform into a full-fledged game.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">Element Space is quite an ambitious project that had me doing everything from designing levels, to coding shaders, animating in-engine, orchestrating cutscenes and integrating the narrative. It was a complete experience for me, and the main reason I chose to join the team: Being able to have a hand in pretty much every part of the game.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">I ended up contributing 7 original levels to the project, all the way from concept to final delivery, along with the visual enhancements and dressing passes of all other stages in the game.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">During my time at Sixth Vowel, I worked alongside people like <a href="https://gameontherails.com/" target="_blank">Brian Upton</a> (Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon) and <a href="https://twitter.com/reduzio?lang=en" target="_blank">Juan Linietsky</a> (Godot Game Engine), and many of the finest and most experienced developers in the country.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">It was a much needed reward for a team that gave everything they had to give during the game's rocky development.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">That's where my story with Sixth Vowel ended, as I moved on to Globant after finishing up my work on the project.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">After one and a half years of hard work, and with one of the best original titles to come out of Argentina finally done, it was hard to say goodbye. However the experience has certainly helped me become a better developer and I was very grateful for being able to be there.</p>
